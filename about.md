Hi, I'm Jason Jea. 

I was born in Texas to Taiwanese immigrant parents and now live in San Francisco, where I lead the data function at Everlane. 

Some things I love:
- writing
- basketball
- trying to copy my mom's cooking
- video games
- learning about the Bay Area asian diaspora
- geeking out
- the California outdoors. I now occasionally camp
